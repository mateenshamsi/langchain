The Symphony of Cricket

Upon the field where green dreams lie,
The sun peers gently from the sky.
Eleven men with hopeful eyes,
Await the ball that twists, that flies.

The bowler runs, his heartbeat fast,
A thunder roars, the ball is cast.
It cuts the air, a searing flame,
The batsman steadies, plays the game.

A willow sound, a sharp sweet crack,
The ball races, the fielders track.
Feet pound the turf, a desperate chase,
Yet boundaries claim the ball’s embrace.

The crowd erupts, their voices soar,
Each cheer an ocean, a thousand more.
The scoreboard climbs with steady pace,
Sweat drips, resolve lights every face.

A spinner comes with guile and art,
He bends the air, deceives the heart.
The ball obeys his subtle hand,
It bites the pitch, it grips the sand.

The batsman misjudges, edges high,
A fielder waits beneath the sky.
Fingers clasp tight, the moment sealed,
A wicket falls, the crowd revealed.

The captain speaks with calm command,
His tactics drawn upon the land.
He sets his men in arc and ring,
Each placement sharp, a thoughtful string.

The game turns fierce, the chase grows near,
Each ball a question, each strike sincere.
The tension hums, the silence breaks,
As destiny waits on choices made.

Then comes the roar, a mighty six,
The ball ascends with fiery tricks.
It clears the ropes, it greets the sky,
As hope and fear together fly.

Overs dwindle, time runs thin,
The line between defeat and win.
A single run, a breath, a glance,
The match now hangs on fate’s last chance.

The bowler storms, his spirit bright,
The batsman strikes with all his might.
The crowd erupts, the stumps give way,
And victory crowns the end of play.

Beyond the field, when noise has died,
The game still beats in every side.
A tale of courage, loss, and fight,
Of summer days and floodlit nights.

For cricket’s more than bat or ball,
It is the heartbeat shared by all.
